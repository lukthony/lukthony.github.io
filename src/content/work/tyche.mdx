import TychePrecursorDemo from '../../components/tyche/TychePrecursorDemo.svelte';

The below demo can handle a thoroughly restricted subset of the Tyche syntax. It can handle basic arithmetic(`+, -, *, /, **`) and dice rolls—but **limitlessly nested**. 

- Try rolling: `d20` 
- Do some basic arithmetic: `3d10 + 4`
- Maybe some arithmetic that doesn't really make sense for dice: `(4d8 ** (1d4)) / 2`
- Or maybe get a little crazy and nest: `(d10)d(4d6)`
- Get even wackier and nest the nesting: `((d10)d(4d6))d(1d20+(d10*3)d8)`

Then hit `evaluate` and watch the dice roller give you a detailed breakdown of the roll.

# Huh?

It's pronounced "[tishe](https://www.google.com/search?q=tyche+pronunciation)"(try saying "ties" with a lisp), like after the Greek goddess of fortune.

Here's the thing: 2D digital dice suck. They've sucked for a while. It seems like every form of digital dice was hacked together as part of a bigger project. "We're trying to make a `[CHARACTER SHEET / VIRTUAL TABLETOP / DISCORD BOT]`, just get it working." Even worse, it makes perfect sense—I don't blame them. No individual should let themselves descend into the delusion of believing they can make the next panacea. The *individual* wants to get their work done—no more no less. Their job isn't to fix the system. The job entry they applied to didn't have the text "fix everybody's problems lol xD" at the bottom. Or, at the very least, I hope they're getting paid pretty damn well if it did.

And yet, I have made the lapse in judgement of falling into the aforementioned delusion.

In the tech world, the answer to the question "has anybody figured out a better way to do this?" is usually *yes*—they have and it's an open source project that'll wash your dishes and shine your shoes the first time you try it. It'll be like heaven on earth. Some smattering of humans came together to make, for free, something that *perfectly* solves your particular problem. You smile at humanity's kindness and pure generosity, and type your `pip install`'s or `cargo add`'s or `pnpm i`'s.

And then you make the mistake of interacting with the real word, where things only get done if they *really*—and I do mean *really*—need to get done. Hazardous, confusing, sluggish, (and frankly broken) systems permeate the computers of every university, business(tech or otherwise), and individual. If the world of open source is a fragrant lavender, the real word pushes your nose into a three-year-old moldy sandwich with burnt hair in place of lettuce.

So sometimes, you just have to make your own damn sandwich.

# Why?

Once upon a time, I, a Dungeons & Dragons nerd through-and-through, decided to make a dice calculator. A little interface like the app that comes on every smartphone and desktop computer, the kind of interface that you'll get access to if you type "calculator" into Google—but for dice.

Then I realized I'd have to make a notation. Just like how calculators need a syntax for the order and form in which you input numbers and operations, so did my dice calculator. 

And then I realized that there's a lot more the average user wants out of dice than just "roll $X$ dice with $Y$ sides(and maybe add or subtract a little)". You might want to keep the $X$ highest dice. Or the $ X $ lowest dice. Or reroll on an $ X $ result. Or, well, you get the idea. There are as many ways to roll dice as there are people in the pews. There exist a million and one tabletop roleplaying games that have made up their own stupid types of dice rolls. Which begs the question: why are current dice roll offerings so opinionated?

If you don't know the current state of the digital dice rolling world(which is the position of the vast majority of people), don't worry about it. However, if you do, please think to yourself: when using a dice bot on Discord, or a dice roller online, or anything of the sort, how quickly can you find something that it can't do—and not only *can't* do, but *can't ever possibly do*. I'd venture pretty quickly. 

Imagine you're a game designer. You want to make the *next big tabletop roleplaying game*. Now, immediately, you have two choices: alienate anybody who wants to roll dice in your game digitally and use a new, quirky system, *or* make your game compatible with the basic D&D style of dice rolling. So, either sacrifice an avenue of potential creativity and innovation, or your audience. 

As a game master for tabletop gaming myself, I strongly believe that your table is your own. There is a wonderful beauty to allowing each and every combination of people to infuse the hobby with whatever quirks and nuances they desire. As such, I believe every aspect of the hobby should facilitate this. Just as Matt Colville says, every DM becomes, is, and always was a game designer. Designers deserve flexible tools. Players, busy with jobs, studies, or responsibilities, deserve to have the tools they use to be as straightforward as possible, consistent across applications and platform. A standard—that's what we need. A way for humans and computers to both understand how the dice should be, will be, and have been tossed. A flexible and extensible standard that anyone can add to. A new dice notation for the digital age. 

This, my friends, is where Tyche comes in. The Tyche Notation: one standard notation to rule them all—to serve every purpose and every game. Let's roll.

## What?

> # ⚠️ Here begins the **Tyche Notation Specification**
>
> This specification describes the syntax for the Tyche Notation, a notation for dice rolls that is human & machine readable, unopinionated, comprehensive, rigorous, flexible, and extensible. 
>
> - `Version: 0.1`
> - `Date: 2023-04-14`

Above all, Tyche follows a number of patterns:

- **Familiar** - Tyche takes inspiration from the dice notation you're already familiar with. If you've ever played a tabletop roleplaying game, you're already mostly familiar. We've just added some things to supercharge the complicated parts and make them easier to understand. We've also made it more consistent and reliable. Want to roll a dice and use the result as the amount of sides another die has? Tyche makes it easy.
- **Flexible** - A key component of Tyche is extensibility. If your implementation of Tyche isn't extensible, it's not Tyche. There's a basic subset of intended features inspired by [Sophie's Dice](https://sophiehoulden.com/dice/documentation/notation.html), but everything past that is up to you. Want to add your own functions, manipulators, and transformations? Simply write some Python and plug it in—that's the standard Tyche sets up. 
- **Feature-filled** - Tyche is designed to cover all the bases. Strings and integers. Arithmetic and functions. Dice and manipulation of them. As best as we can, we've tried to make Tyche the most comprehensive standard possible.

Please also note that *Tyche is unimplemented*. This is a specification that defines the rules an implementation should follow. It, by consequence, defines the usage of the notation. At time of writing, an implementation is currently being written in the Rust programming language. A working  implementation of a subset of Tyche's features(infinitely nestable dice rolls and arithmetic) is available at the top of this page. Or, if you're reading this standard on the Github repo for this project, at [mirth.cc/work/tyche](https://mirth.cc/work/tyche).

## Pieces

The atomic components of Tyche are as follows:

 - **Dice** - A dice roll. `XdY`, where `X` is the number of dice to roll, and `Y` is the number of sides on each die. 
   - **Manipulators** - Dice may also have manipulators, which present in the form `XdYmZ` or `XdYm{arg1, arg2, arg3, ...}`. `m` is the manipulator's identifier, and `Z` or `{arg1, arg2, arg3, ...}` are the arguments to the manipulator. 
 - **Numbers** - A decimal number, with no real limit on the number of digits or presence of a decimal point.
 - **Strings** - A string of characters, enclosed in either single or double quotes.
 - **Functions** - A function call. `function_name(arg1, arg2, arg3, ...)`, where `function_name` is the name of the function, and `arg1`, `arg2`, `arg3`, etc. are the arguments to the function.
 
 The above can stand alone or be combined with **arithmetic operators—**`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `(`, and `)`—to form expressions. Expressions can be nested infinitely. Expressions can also be acted on by "**Transformers**", which take the form `expression.T(arg1, arg2, arg3, ...)`, where `expression` is the expression to be transformed, `T` is the transformer's identifier, and `arg1`, `arg2`, `arg3`, etc. are the arguments to the transformer.

 ## In practice

Below are some basic examples of Tyche expressions. 

 > `2d6 + 4 - 1` — arithmetic with dice
>
> `4d10 / 2 * 3` — division and multiplication
>
> `3d6 + (d4 / 2)` — parentheses for order of operations
>
> `2d6, 4d8` — multiple dice rolls
>
> `d4, 2d6 + 3, (d20/3) + (1d4, 1d6)` — multiple dice roll expressions
>
> `d20` — shorthand for `1d20`
>
> `d%` — shorthand for `1d100`
>
> `dF` — shorthand for `1dF`

Expressions can be combined in Tyche in the form of a "**Tychain**", a comma-separated list of expressions. A Tychain is the top-level unit that a Tyche parser works with. You give it a list of expressions, and it rolls them and returns the result.

# ARCHIVE

Welcome to a **new standard for dice roll notation**. One standard notation to rule them all, to serve every purpose and every game. Welcome to Tyche.

> # ⚠️ Quick note for developers
>
> Do you want to use Tyche in your project? We've made it easy. We offer the following:
>
> For development:
>
> - TycheJS, an NPM module for JavaScript and TypeScript
> - TychePy, a Python module
>
> Both of which are built off of tyche-core, a Rust crate.
>
> For testing:
>
> - PlutusCLI, a command line interface
> - PlutusWeb, a web app interface

## Tyche Notation

> Draft Version 0.1.0

The Tyche notation follows the same patterns you're already used to:

> `XdY` — rolls `X` dice with `Y` sides

Imagine a basic dice calculator. All the features you'd expect are available:

> `2d6 + 4 - 1` — arithmetic with dice
>
> `4d10 / 2 * 3` — division and multiplication
>
> `3d6 + (d4 / 2)` — parentheses for order of operations
>
> `2d6, 4d8` — multiple dice rolls
>
> `d4, 2d6 + 3, (d20/3) + (1d4, 1d6)` — multiple dice roll expressions
>
> `d20` — shorthand for `1d20`
>
> `d%` — shorthand for `1d100`
>
> `dF` — shorthand for `1dF`

But Tyche is more flexible. It's extensible. You can add your own of any of the following:

> These can be added in the dice parser session itself:
>
> `$name = 4` — define **variables**
>
> `d<'Fuck','Marry','Kill'>` - define **custom dice**
>
> And these can be added with plugins written in Python:
>
> `XdYM` — dice **modifiers**
>
> `name(XdY)` — dice **functions**
> 
> `X [SYMBOL] Y` — **arithmetic operators**
