It's pronounced ["tishe"](https://www.google.com/search?q=tyche+pronunciation)(try saying "ties" with a lisp), like after the Greek goddess of fortune.

Welcome to a **new standard for dice roll notation**. One standard notation to rule them all, to serve every purpose and every game. Welcome to Tyche.

> # ⚠️ Quick note for developers
>
> Do you want to use Tyche in your project? We've made it easy. We offer the following:
>
> For development:
>
> - TycheJS, an NPM module for JavaScript and TypeScript
> - TychePy, a Python module
>
> Both of which are built off of tyche-core, a Rust crate.
>
> For testing:
>
> - PlutusCLI, a command line interface
> - PlutusWeb, a web app interface

## Tyche Notation

> Draft Version 0.1.0

The Tyche notation follows the same patterns you're already used to:

> `XdY` — rolls `X` dice with `Y` sides

Imagine a basic dice calculator. All the features you'd expect are available:

> `2d6 + 4 - 1` — arithmetic with dice
>
> `4d10 / 2 * 3` — division and multiplication
>
> `3d6 + (d4 / 2)` — parentheses for order of operations
>
> `2d6, 4d8` — multiple dice rolls
>
> `d4, 2d6 + 3, (d20/3) + (1d4, 1d6)` — multiple dice roll expressions
>
> `d20` — shorthand for `1d20`
>
> `d%` — shorthand for `1d100`
>
> `dF` — shorthand for `1dF`

But Tyche is more flexible. It's extensible. You can add your own of any of the following:

> These can be added in the dice parser session itself:
>
> `$name = 4` — define **variables**
>
> `d<'Fuck','Marry','Kill'>` - define **custom dice**
>
> And these can be added with plugins written in Python:
>
> `XdYM` — dice **modifiers**
>
> `name(XdY)` — dice **functions**
> 
> `X [SYMBOL] Y` — **arithmetic operators**
