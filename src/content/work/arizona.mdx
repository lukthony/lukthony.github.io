A software engineer(ing student) by day, graphic designer by night. Once upon a time, I had my sights set on either being a computer scientist or graphic designer, and so I spent a great deal of time on both sides of the fence. I've since thrown in my lot with the computer science side, but I'll always have a soft spot for design. Below is a project I did at the tail end of high school while building my portfolio for art school. 

I love Arizona iced tea and thought it'd be fun to update their remarkably archaic(yet inarguably iconic) branding. The main thrust of the project was to use a different geological formation for each beverage. Canyon iced tea, Ravine hard iced tea, Mountain energy drink, and Valley sleep drink. Each labeled with a clean "An Arizona Brand" tagline. Take a gander!
