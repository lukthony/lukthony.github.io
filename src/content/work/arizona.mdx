{/* I'm a software engineer(ing student) by day, graphic designer by night.  */}

Once upon a time, I had my sights set on being either a computer scientist or graphic designer. Thus, I spent a great deal of time on both sides of the fence. I've since thrown in my lot with the techies, but graphic design will always hold a place in my heart. This AriZona Beverage Company rebrand is a project I did at the tail end of high school while building my portfolio. 

I love AriZona brand iced tea and thought it'd be fun to update their remarkably archaic(yet inarguably iconic) branding. The main thrust of the project was to use a different geological formation for each beverage. *Canyon* Iced Tea, *Ravine* Hard Iced Tea, *Mountain* Energy Drink, and *Valley* Sleep Drink. Each labeled with "An Arizona Brand" as a tagline. Take a gander!
