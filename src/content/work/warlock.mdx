This project has been, by far, my largest and most complicated technical undertaking. The process involved [deciphering a terribly documented university API](https://mirth.cc/blog/deciphering-uiuc) & writing [a module to fix it](https://github.com/lumirth/cisurls), as well as writing [a Python module to interact with RateMyProfessor](https://github.com/lumirth/rmpy) from scratch, writing [a system to dynamically parse search queries into a set of advanced parameters](https://github.com/lumirth/warlock/blob/main/backend/app/models/parse.py), and a whole host more. As a result, I have yet to give a complete writeup of the project. This is where that writeup will exist once I'm clear of finals and the spring semester and have a chance to sit down and write it.

Until then, you can use Course Warlock at [warlock.mirth.cc](https://warlock.mirth.cc) and view the source code [on my GitHub](https://github.com/lumirth/warlock).
