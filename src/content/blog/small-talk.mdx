Every time I hear about small talk, I find myself endlessly confused. Never once have I considered small talk some sort of mechanical problem. "Oh, here I am, trapped in conversation. I suppose I've got to make small talk, *again*." The sentiment has never made sense to me. It seems short-sighted and pessimistic. Every person has their own unique perspective and insight, and, even if you're only going to speak to them for a brief moment—even *if* they're terrible at comunicating—every single person has *some* nugget of insight that'll help you grow or change your life in interesting and unexpected ways. Why throw away that opportunity and pretend that society is demanding you talk about the weather? No one has ever been truly forced to have the stupid conversations of small talk. They *choose* to have them instead of anything more genuine or honest. Why? Why do we do this? Why do we pretend that small talk is necessary?

Who do we have small talk with? Strangers, acquaintances, coworkers? Every single one of these people is worth having a better conversation with. I saw someone complaining in the comments of a video about small talk that small talk is the conversation you have with somebody you don't want to talk to. Here's a hot take—stop being a coward and a liar. Stop being placid. They used the example of making coffee at work and somebody coming up to you. Which—man—I cannot describe my anger for. For somebody to see you making coffee in a commonplace at work and try to chat—that's a gesture of kindess, of social regard. It's acknowledging you and yoru value and presence in the space. To pretend that talking to them is some insult, some obligation? It's rotten. If you don't want to talk to someone, don't be an ass and *tell them*. Say, "hey man, it's nice to see you. Fair warning, I'm not in a chatty mood." Or, if you're too much of a coward to do that, then play along politely. Don't say anything you don't have to and let the silence give them space to speak. There are so many ways to indicate you don't want to talk and fake-talking is not one of them. If you want people to understand when you don't want to talk, you have to communicate that to them. Otherwise, you don't have the right to complain.

Conversations are like improv. Which, well, obviously—they're both improvisational. You see, in improv there's this idea of "the first unusual thing". Two people might be going back and forth in a scene until somebody says or implies something strange or unusual. Something that we wouldn't write if we were *trying* to be realistic. SOmebody witn some perspective or object or other X factor that doesn't make full sense. And that's where "the game" starts. It all comes from riffing off of the first diversion from reality. 

I think conversation is the same in that sure, the beginning might seem normal and boring(what we might call "small talk"), but it's merely a setup for the game that follows. If you're strangers or acquaintances, it helps establish your moods, your demeanors, or your demographic characteristics(major, job, hobbies, etc), or the surrounding environment(weather, traffic, etc) and from that you can tell a story from a set of common facts. It's like playing a tabletop roleplaing game, except the role you're playing is you. Dungeons and Dragons doesn't have small talk. You want to know why? Because the characters and world are interesting. But guess what? **THIS** world and **THESE** characters—the people in it—are INTERESTING TOO. People are interesting. The world is interesting. Small talk shouldn't exist.

And, where it does exist, it should be relegated to such a small role as to be barely a footnote in the social sphere. I've had somebody respond to this take with "Yeah, and you're gonna pour your heat out to your boss and risk them thinking you're weird? You need small talk to keep your image safe". Here's the thing—that's not how an image works. When you keep your cards close to the chest, you're not building an image of mystery, you're building an image of somebody afraid to communicate, to show vulnerability. Jobs are necessarily cooperative. You work for the same company—to at least some degree, your goals are aligned. Your boss is human too, and it is in both your and their best interest for each of you to have an idea of who the other is. If their job is to manage you, both you and them benefit from more understanding between you. If you've heard them explain their thinking on a topic—even something as un-work-related as sports or other leisure—you may be better able to explain your instructions, orders, goals, or ideas in a way that makes sense to them. And, if your boss is better at managing you, you can get better work done and chafe less against the world around you. Nobody's asking you to pour childhood trauma on a stranger, but for pete's sake, don't be afraid to be a person. 

Believing in small talk as a concept is a fundamentally aversarial view of the social world. Other humans are not enemies until proven otherwise. Maybe, just maybe, we should treat each other as innocent until proven guilty of being assholes or demons or shitty or boring. Treat people with love and talk to them like they're an old friend no matter how long you've known each other. Show camaraderie, damn it. I have people in my contacts list that I've had single conversations with yet I could tell you their name and exactly what we talked about because we were willing to actually *talk* about something. Last year I met a guy named Luke, and we chatted about the game I was playing at the time, Deathloop. We had a really engaging conversation about the mechanics of the developer's past games and how they'd been imporved and polished in their latest entry. it was a great moment of connection over something we both cared about, and now both I remember him and he remembers me when we bump into eachother—yet we've only really spoken once. I have the contact of somebody I bumped into on the bus to the career fair and I can tell you their major and exactly what they were stressed out about in regards to the fair. Would that be true if we had just gone "yeah fair's gonna be packed as usual" and moved on? Absolutely not. I am so averse to small talk that I could turn that boring interaction into something interesting simply by talking *about* it in an interesting way. "Oh, I definitely don't envy the sardine. You ready to be inhaling somebody else's exhale for a couple hours?" Already, I've used interesting imagery and a jovial tone to create an air of casuality to the conversation. Or, maybe it's a chance for other thoughts and ideas—maybe it wasn't as packed as the previous there, and we can wonder out loud about it together. We can talk about how we made our resume and why. We can judge eachother and catch any flaws we might want to fix in the next iteration. For all intents and purposes you would call such a conversation a small talk conversation. But for me, it would never be one. Because it shouldn't be. Small talk isn't real, and small talk should die.

## Addendum

After thinking some more about it, I'd like to add the caveat of safety. There are, in fact, a broad swath of situations in which it is advantageous to withhold as much information as possible in order to protect yourself. Whether that be a woman talking to a creepy guy in an effort not to set him off, or a teenager omiting information when talking to a parent so they can't use it against them, there are a variety of situations in which talking for the sake of talking is warranted. That said, I don't think this type of conversation, with these sort of stakes, falls under the definition of small talk. Or, at least, I don't think it should. In fact, I myself have been in situations where somebody else might've used small talk to avoid saying anything, but my strategy generally differs. When I'm talking to somebody with whom I don't want to be vulnerable or don't want to speak about certain things, I'm not suddenly mumbling about the weather. Instead, I simply shift the *kind* of things I talk about away from myself. I'll describe some thing I have knowledge about or I'll give some passionate yet impersonal opinion about something. 

Point being, I think there are a lot of different strategies for talking to people, and small talk is one of the worst. It's a facile, cowardly, on-the-back-foot kind of conversation that removes both your autonomy and theirs. At the very least, viewing the world through the lens of small talk pretends everything is a lot more boring than it actually is. 

Improvise more, when you're talking. My favorite question to ask myself when I'm on the improv stage is "if this is true, what else is true? And that's what you should do when you converse. Talking about the weather? Could that not easily turn into a conversation about the different types of cloud? A reminiscence about what it was like to learn about clouds in grade school. Or it could turn into a funny story about how once upon a time you found yourself marching through the rain with a gallon of milk in each hang. Thinking in small talk imagines that the conversation can't go any farther, *because* it's small talk. The best kind of person never talks small. They talk big. They say something. Be someone. Say something.
