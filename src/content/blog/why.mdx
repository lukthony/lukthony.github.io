Just over thirteen and a half years ago at time of writing, one of the most insightful minds in programming Alt-F4'd his online presence.

Today, I want to talk about why. And _why. I want to talk about why _why left. I want to explain to you why he was great, and why I hope he doesn't come back. As a writer, nobody has made me feel more desperate to emulate them than _why. His bewilderingly distracted and winding writing style is so ruthlessly engaging that I can't help but pour over every word again, and again, and again. Programmers and laymen alike, gather round. Let us recount the tale of _why, the lucky stiff.

# Why he's gone

To start at the end, here's a quote from _why's last post:

> programming is rather thankless. u see your works become replaced by superior ones in a year. unable to run at all in a few more.

> Pretend that you’ve opened this book (although you probably have opened this book), just to find a huge onion right in the middle crease of the book. (The manufacturer of the book has included the onion at my request.)
>
> So you’re like, “Wow, this book comes with an onion!” (Even if you don’t particularly like onions, I’m sure you can appreciate the logistics of shipping any sort of produce discreetly inside of an alleged programming manual.)

> Then you ask yourself, “Wait a minute. I thought this was a book on Ruby ... Why an onion? What am I supposed to do with it?”

> I’ll be straight with you. I want you to cry. To weep. To whimper sweetly. This book is a poignant guide to Ruby. That means code so beautiful that tears are shed. That means gallant tales and somber truths that have you waking up the next morning in the arms of this book. Hugging it tightly to you all the day long. If necessary, fashion a makeshift hip holster for Why’s (Poignant) Guide to Ruby, so you can always have this book’s tender companionship.
