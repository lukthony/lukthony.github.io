Markdown Syntax Demo
====================

This is a _Markdown_ **Syntax** Demo document for testing purposes. We will cover various aspects of markdown in this document.

# Welcome to :style[Magic MDX]{.shine} with Astro

If you have used [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) before, you might have noticed that MDX files tend to become quite technical.

For us tech nerds, that is mostly fine, and being able to write the content of our technical documents in Markdown is already a big gain. But for non-tech content-editors, writing this style of markdown is quite a burden, and actually I realized, that it is quite a burden for my mind, too.

::Quote[I like my content to be clean, so I decided to **dust off my MDX** with **astro-m2dx**.]{author='Christian' from='Hack Your Shack' avatar='./christian.png'}

With the arrival of [Astro v1.0](https://astro.build)ðŸš€ and it's [MDX Integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/), there was the chance to implement a publication pipeline that provides content-editors with the ability to write almost clean markdown, with some directives, only a few sprinkles of JSX and without overloading the frontmatter: **Astro Magic MDX** aka [**astro-m2dx**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-m2dx) was born.

Astro MÂ²DX is a [**remark** plugin](https://remark.js.org/), that you can use in your Astro site generator, to keep your MDX close to Markdown, while still using all of the rich MDX features.
