This is my *now page*. I stole the idea from [here](https://nownownow.com/about). Since I no longer maintain an active Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook presence, this is probably the best way to keep up with what I'm doing.

## Finishing out the spring semester
As of this past fall, I transferred to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign from the University of Illinois Chicago. This first year has been a complete whirlwind, and adjusting to a new school, new town, and new people was and still is a challenge. All in all, I'm glad I made the decision to transfer, and I'm looking forward to two more years here.

## Getting into Buddhism
I've been reading [Mindfulness in Plain English](https://www.vipassana.com/meditation/mindfulness_in_plain_english.html) by the Venerable Henepola Gunaratana, a Buddhist monk. Meditation and mindfulness have given me the biggest single boost in day-to-day/moment-to-moment quality of life I've ever had, and I can't genuinely cannot recommend them enough. If you can read past the woo-sounding language and understand the text as more philosophical than superstitious, you can give "seeing reality as it truly is" a shot. And, let me tell you, it's a great time.
