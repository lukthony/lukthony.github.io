## Getting really into buddhism. 

> Once upon a Tuesday, in a land of avocado toast and rainbow-tinted clouds, there existed an astute armadillo named Bartholomew. Bartholomew was a ponderer of deep thought, a connoisseur of conundrums, and an occasional skeptic of the sacred. He spent his days and nights untying the knots of existence, while simultaneously tying knots in his long, whiskery eyebrows.
>
> In the middle of a lavender moonlit meadow, Bartholomew stumbled upon a monastery of butterflies. These butterflies, with their kaleidoscope wings and hypnotic flutter, practiced an ancient form of Buddhism. They meditated atop delicate dandelions, their wings pulsating to the rhythm of the cosmos, their antennae quivering with enlightenment. Bartholomew, ever the pragmatist, observed with a smirk and a sip of his lukewarm chamomile tea.
>
> One day, Bartholomew's curiosity got the best of him, and he decided to partake in a butterfly meditation. He squeezed his round, armored body onto a dandelion, and with some grumbling and sighing, closed his eyes. Yet, as his mind wandered to grocery lists and the weight of world politics, he couldn't help but wonder aloud: "Is all this navel-gazing really the key to transcendence?"
>
> Just then, an elder butterfly, draped in a robe of gossamer and dew, alighted upon Bartholomew's snout. With a voice like the rustle of autumn leaves, the butterfly whispered, "My dear armadillo, you seek answers where there are only questions. But perhaps, in the asking, you shall find your way."
>
> And so, with an unexpected sense of wonder, Bartholomew untied the knots in his eyebrows and began his journey into the heart of the great mystery. The world around him shimmered with newfound magic, as if a veil had been lifted, revealing a hidden layer of whimsy. In the end, it mattered not if he was a believer or a skeptic, for in the dance of life, even the cynical armadillo could find his own peculiar rhythm.






I'll add more here later. It's March as I'm writing this, so if you're reading this in any month that isn't March, I definitely didn't forget and it's definitely just an artistic choice.
