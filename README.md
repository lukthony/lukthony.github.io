# [MIRTH.CC]

This is the source code for the [`[MIRTH.CC]`](https://mirth.cc) website. It's a static site built with [Astro](https://astro.build). Hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and deployed with Github Actions.

I made this site to have a place to keep projects worth sharing and to have a place to share some thoughts. I built it to be as performant as I felt I could, in an attempt to make a smooth browsing experience.
