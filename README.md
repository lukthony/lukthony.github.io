# [MIRTH.CC]

This is the source code for the [`[MIRTH.CC]`](https://mirth.cc) website. It's a static site built with [Astro](https://astro.build). Hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and deployed with Github Actions.

I made this site to have a place to keep projects worth sharing and to have a place to dump my thoughts. I built it to be as speedy as I could manage in the week-long span I spent tinkering on it. 

If there's interest in a template form of this site, I'll consider making one.
