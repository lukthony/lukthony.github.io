# MIRTH

This is the source code for the [mirth.cc](https://mirth.cc) website. It's a static site built with [Astro](https://astro.build). Hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and deployed with Github Actions. Astro is used for its static site generation capabilities along with its [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) support, allowing for Svelte (along with Vue.js, React, Angular, etc.) within otherwise static content. An example of this can be found on the [work/tyche](https://mirth.cc/work/tyche) page. 

I've organized my site as follows:
- [`/`](https://mirth.cc) - A landing page with latest post/project.
- [`/blog`](https://mirth.cc/blog) - A feed of posts containing my writing. No theme or category limits. Just contains anything I felt worth sharing.
- [`/work`](https://mirth.cc/work) - Projects, technical, artistic or otherwise. Effectively a portfolio.
- [`/info`](https://mirth.cc/info) - An "about" page except "info" is 4 letters like the other pages. May add a [now page](https://nownownow.com) from here.
