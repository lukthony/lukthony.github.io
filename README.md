# MIRTH

This is the source code for the [mirth.cc](https://mirth.cc) website. It's a static site built with [Astro](https://astro.build). Hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and deployed with Github Actions. Astro is used for its static site generation capabilities along with its [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) support, allowing for Svelte (along with Vue.js, React, Angular, etc.) within otherwise static content. An example of this can be found on the [work/tyche](https://mirth.cc/work/tyche) page. 

I've organized my site as follows:
- [`/`](https://mirth.cc) - A simple, welcoming page linking to the most recent blog post and project.
- [`/work`](https://mirth.cc/work) - Projects, technical, artistic or otherwise, are presented here. This is effectively a portfolio.
- [`/blog`](https://mirth.cc/blog) - Just what it sounds like. A feed of posts containing my writing. It contains just about anything I deemed worth typing up and sharing.
- [`/info`](https://mirth.cc/info) - General information about me and the website. I hope to one day link to a [now page](https://nownownow.com) from here.

I chose the word 'work' instead of 'projects' or 'portfolios' mostly because it was four letters long and fit better alongide 'blog' and 'info'. That said, I also feel the word better represents what I want to show off on the page. 

I made this site to have a place to keep projects and writing worth sharing. I built it to be as performant as reasonably possible to allow for a smooth browsing experience. People don't spend much time on personal websitesâ€”may as well make it a good experience while they're there.
